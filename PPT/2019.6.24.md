Today is Jun. 24th. This is the first day of research. The professor gave us the topic that we would do in the next few weeks. We also met the upperclassman from SUSTech. Pretty Interesting. And I am now still finding the paper that is relative to this topic. It's pretty a original topic, so I should it by myself. And first to find out if it can be resolved.



It's 4 o'clock but i still haven't found the way.

22:44

Today, I do some work about the project. I found lots of papers, but didn't read in detail. I think tomorrow I need read more carefully. And start to learn English. I really love the scene of Tsinghua, both physical and cultural. I think I should control my time of using telephone. I mean I should concentrate my attention into the research. And I know this is a pretty challenging project, successful or failure, it depends on ourselves.

Sleeping early and getting up early is also I should first consider. And I hope I can go to fitness room  every day. Repeat, recite English, write diary and do exercise every day!
